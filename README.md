# Initial-Coin-Offering-Success-Prediction
Crowdfunding involves multiple individuals contributing funds to support a company or project, typically facilitated online through a designated website or governing body. Companies often promote their initiatives through various channels to achieve their fundraising goals. A distinctive form of crowdfunding, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), allows companies to raise funds by offering new digital coins or tokens to investors in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin. These ICOs are based on distributed ledger technology and enable the issued coins to be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges or within the enterprise's ecosystem (Agrawal, Catalini, & Goldfarb, 2015; Fisch, 2019).

This emerging crowdfunding method is largely unregulated (Cronqvist, Siegel, & Yu, 2015) and often attracts speculative investors seeking potential returns from the success of the proposed venture. ICOs are predominantly utilized by early-stage firms or projects that are yet to develop a service, platform, or product (Huang, Vismara, & Wei). The primary objective is to successfully raise funds for the business or platform underpinning the ICO.  

This study uses machine learning models to predict whether a project or company can secure funds through an ICO. Data from over 2,000 projects from diverse firms and teams will be used to analyze the factors contributing to ICO success. The provided dataset includes various ICO initiatives and their outcomes, with a binary target variable ("Yes" or "No"), indicating that this is a classification problem. Four classification models will be trained and tested, and the model with the best performance on unseen data will be identified.
